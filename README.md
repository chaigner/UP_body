# UP_body

This code loads 31 in vivo B1+ datasets and computes and evaluates tailored and 
universal (22 B1+ datasets) kT-point pulses as described in:

Christoph S. Aigner, Sebastian Dietrich, Tobias Schaeffter and Sebastian
Schmitter, Calibration-free pTx of the human heart at 7T via 3D universal 
pulses, submitted to Magn. Reson. Med. 2021

All B1+ datasets from the publication are available at: ....

The optimization of the kT-points is performed using code by Zhipeng Cao 
and Will Grissom (https://bitbucket.org/wgrissom/acptx/) who have given 
permission for inclusion within this package. Please cite appropriately.
